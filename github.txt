I went to Five-Thirty-Eight’s repository and found a project about gun deaths. I couldn’t access the whole data set the website is working with, but I was able to see a modified set that appears to be for an interactive they’re making.

I chose this because I think gun violence is a very serious issue. It’s really important for people to see the data on it to understand the scope of the issue.

The site has grouped the number of guns deaths by age, race, gender, and intent. (ex. suicide, homicide, etc.) From what I can tell, the user can search using multiple factors or search by one factor. So I could search for gun deaths of Hispanic women aged 15-34 or just gun deaths of all Hispanic people in the U.S. It also shows the rate of gun deaths for each group/factor. The repository also includes the coding for the interactive.

It seems like it’s a useful tool to see how different groups are affected differently by gun violence.

Questions:

1. Why did you decide to organize the data by race, age, gender, and intent?

2. How long did it take to write the code for the interactive?

3. What glitches or issues that came up during the project? How did you solve them?
